# Granular Per-Feature Control - Update Summary

## What Changed

The Migration Feature Management Service now supports **granular per-feature control**! Instead of enabling or disabling all features together, you can now control each feature individually.

## Key Changes

### 1. Excel Structure Updated

**Before (All-or-Nothing):**
```
| Rule Name | Wave | Conditions... | ACTION |
|-----------|------|---------------|--------|
| Rule 1    | WAVE1| ...          | suppressAllFeatures() |
```

**After (Per-Feature Control):**
```
| Rule Name | Wave | Conditions... | feature1 | feature2 | feature3 | feature4 |
|-----------|------|---------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Rule 1    | WAVE1| ...          | disabled | disabled | enabled  | disabled |
```

### 2. Feature Values

Each feature column can have:
- `enabled` - Feature is ON
- `disabled` - Feature is OFF
- (blank) - Use default (enabled)

### 3. Default Behavior

**Features not explicitly set in rules default to ENABLED.** This is a safe default that ensures features work unless explicitly disabled.

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Mixed Feature Access

**WAVE1 customers with savings only:**
- feature1: disabled
- feature2: disabled
- feature3: enabled ← Different from others!
- feature4: disabled

In Excel:
```
| WAVE1 Savings | WAVE1 | true | false | false | disabled | disabled | enabled | disabled |
```

### Scenario 2: Gradual Rollout

Week 1: Enable only feature1
```
| WAVE1 Week1 | WAVE1 | true | false | false | enabled | disabled | disabled | disabled |
```

Week 2: Enable feature1 and feature2
```
| WAVE1 Week2 | WAVE1 | true | false | false | enabled | enabled | disabled | disabled |
```

### Scenario 3: Emergency Disable

Need to quickly disable feature2 for all WAVE1 customers? Just change column G to `disabled` in all WAVE1 rules.

## API Response Changes

### Before
```json
{
  "customerId": "CUST001",
  "features": [
    {
      "feature": "feature1",
      "enabled": false,
      "reason": "WAVE1: Customer with savings/cd only is being migrated to BankB"
    },
    {
      "feature": "feature2",
      "enabled": false,
      "reason": "WAVE1: Customer with savings/cd only is being migrated to BankB"
    }
  ]
}
```

### After (with mixed features)
```json
{
  "customerId": "CUST001",
  "features": [
    {
      "feature": "feature1",
      "enabled": false,
      "reason": "WAVE1: feature1 disabled"
    },
    {
      "feature": "feature2",
      "enabled": false,
      "reason": "WAVE1: feature2 disabled"
    },
    {
      "feature": "feature3",
      "enabled": true,
      "reason": "WAVE1: feature3 enabled"
    },
    {
      "feature": "feature4",
      "enabled": false,
      "reason": "WAVE1: feature4 disabled"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Code Changes

### CustomerMigrationContext

**Added methods:**
- `setFeatureStatus(String feature, boolean enabled, String reason)` - Set individual feature
- `setFeature1(String status)` - Called by Drools for feature1 column
- `setFeature2(String status)` - Called by Drools for feature2 column
- `setFeature3(String status)` - Called by Drools for feature3 column
- `setFeature4(String status)` - Called by Drools for feature4 column
- `applyDefaults()` - Apply enabled default for unset features

**Deprecated methods (still work but not recommended):**
- `suppressAllFeatures(String reason)`
- `enableAllFeatures(String reason)`

### FeatureDecisionService

**Added:**
- Call to `context.applyDefaults()` after rules fire
- This ensures features not explicitly set default to enabled

### CSV File

**Updated structure:**
- Removed single ACTION column
- Added feature1, feature2, feature3, feature4 columns
- Each feature column can be enabled/disabled/blank

## Migration Guide

If you have custom rules in the old format, here's how to convert:

### Old Format
```csv
...,ACTION
...,"$context.suppressAllFeatures(""reason"");"
```

### New Format
```csv
...,feature1,feature2,feature3,feature4
...,disabled,disabled,disabled,disabled
```

### Conversion Rules
- `suppressAllFeatures()` → all features = `disabled`
- `enableAllFeatures()` → all features = `enabled`

## Adding More Features

The system is extensible. To add feature5:

### 1. Update Excel (Columns)
- Row 7, Column J: `ACTION`
- Row 8, Column J: `feature5`
- Row 9, Column J: `$context`
- Rows 10+, Column J: `enabled` or `disabled`

### 2. Update Code (Java)
Add to `CustomerMigrationContext.java`:
```java
public void setFeature5(String status) {
    if (status != null && !status.trim().isEmpty()) {
        setFeatureStatus("feature5", "enabled".equalsIgnoreCase(status), 
            getCurrentWave() + ": feature5 " + status);
    }
}
```

### 3. Restart Application

## Benefits

✅ **Granular Control** - Each feature can be independently controlled  
✅ **Flexible** - Different rules can have different feature combinations  
✅ **Safe Default** - Features enabled unless explicitly disabled  
✅ **Extensible** - Easy to add new features without major changes  
✅ **Visual** - See all feature states in a spreadsheet  
✅ **Business-Friendly** - Non-technical users can modify  
✅ **Gradual Rollout** - Enable features one at a time  
✅ **A/B Testing** - Test different feature combinations  
✅ **Emergency Response** - Quickly disable problematic features  

## Testing

All existing test scenarios still work, but you now have more flexibility:

### Test 1: WAVE1 Savings Only - All Features Disabled
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/features/check \
  -H "customerId: CUST001" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"features": ["feature1", "feature2", "feature3", "feature4"]}'
```

Expected: All features disabled (same as before)

### Test 2: Custom Feature Mix (NEW!)
Update Excel to have mixed features for CUST001, then:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/features/check \
  -H "customerId: CUST001" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"features": ["feature1", "feature2", "feature3", "feature4"]}'
```

Expected: Mixed results (feature1=OFF, feature2=OFF, feature3=ON, feature4=OFF)

## Documentation Updated

✅ **EXCEL_RULES_TEMPLATE.md** - Updated with per-feature columns  
✅ **BUSINESS_USER_GUIDE.md** - Updated with per-feature examples  
✅ **README.md** - Updated with new structure  
✅ **QUICKSTART.md** - Updated with granular control examples  
✅ **GRANULAR_FEATURE_UPDATE.md** - This file!  

## Backward Compatibility

The old methods (`suppressAllFeatures`, `enableAllFeatures`) are deprecated but still work. They will set all features to the same state, which is equivalent to setting all feature columns to the same value in Excel.

**Recommendation:** Migrate to the new format to take advantage of granular control.

## Summary

You now have **complete control** over individual features! This gives you:
- More flexibility in managing migrations
- Ability to do gradual rollouts
- Quick emergency disabling of specific features
- Easy A/B testing of feature combinations
- Business user-friendly Excel interface

**No code changes needed to modify feature states - just update Excel and restart!**
