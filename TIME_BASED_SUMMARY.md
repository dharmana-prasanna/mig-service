# Time-Based Feature Control - Implementation Summary

## âœ… Implementation Complete!

The system now supports **time-based feature control** with configurable hours before migration in the Excel rules file!

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Code Changes

**CustomerMigrationContext.java**
- Added `isWithinMigrationWindow(int hoursBeforeMigration)` method
- Checks if current server time is within the configured window before migration
- Returns true if: `now >= (migrationDate - hours) AND now < (migrationDate + 1 day)`

**No other code changes needed!** All configuration is in Excel.

### 2. Updated CSV Structure

Added **Column D: isWithinMigrationWindow(int)**

**WAVE1 Rules (Rows 12-14):** Use `7` hours before migration  
**WAVE2 Rules (Rows 15-16):** Use `12` hours before migration  
**Priority Rules (Rows 10-11):** No time check (blank)  

### 3. Documentation Created (3 comprehensive files!)

1. **TIME_BASED_CONTROL.md** (~600 lines)
   - Complete explanation
   - Timeline visualizations
   - Configuration guide
   - FAQ section

2. **TIME_BASED_EXAMPLES.md** (~400 lines)
   - Real-world timeline examples
   - Hour-by-hour walkthrough
   - WAVE1 and WAVE2 examples

3. **TIME_WINDOW_TEST.md** (~500 lines)
   - 9 detailed test scenarios
   - Before, during, and after window tests
   - Expected responses

### 4. Documentation Updated

- âœ… README.md - Time-based control section
- âœ… ALL_RULES_IN_CSV.md - Updated with Column D explanation

## How It Works

### Formula
```
Window Start = Migration Date - Hours Before Migration

Example:
Migration: Saturday 12:00 AM
Hours: 7
Window Start: Friday 5:00 PM
```

### Timeline
```
Thursday         Friday 5PM           Saturday 12AM        Sunday
   |                |                      |                  |
   |                |<---WINDOW----------->|                  |
   |                |                      |                  |
Normal Op      Restrictions          Migration          Complete
Features ON    Apply Rules           In Progress        Features ON
```

### Excel Configuration

| Rule | Column D (Hours) | Window Start |
|------|------------------|--------------|
| WAVE1 | 7 | 7 hours before = Fri 5PM |
| WAVE2 | 12 | 12 hours before = Fri 12PM |

## Current Configuration

### WAVE1 Rules: 7 Hours Before
- Migration: Saturday 12:00 AM
- Window starts: **Friday 5:00 PM**
- Duration: ~31 hours (Friday 5PM to Saturday midnight + 1 day buffer)

### WAVE2 Rules: 12 Hours Before
- Migration: Saturday 12:00 AM
- Window starts: **Friday 12:00 PM (noon)**
- Duration: ~36 hours (Friday noon to Saturday midnight + 1 day buffer)

## Example Responses

### Before Window (Thursday 10PM)
```json
{
  "customerId": "CUST001",
  "features": [
    {
      "feature": "feature1",
      "enabled": true,
      "reason": "Default: Feature enabled (not specified in rules)"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Why:** Time window not started yet, rules don't match, features default to enabled.

### Within Window (Friday 8PM)
```json
{
  "customerId": "CUST001",
  "features": [
    {
      "feature": "feature1",
      "enabled": false,
      "reason": "WAVE1: feature1 disabled"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Why:** Within window, WAVE1 rules match and apply, features controlled per Excel.

## Benefits Delivered

âœ… **Automated Timing** - No manual intervention needed  
âœ… **Seamless Transition** - Features automatically restricted at configured time  
âœ… **Business Control** - Change hours in Excel without code deployment  
âœ… **Flexible Configuration** - Different hours per wave (WAVE1=7, WAVE2=12)  
âœ… **Normal Operation** - Features work until window starts  
âœ… **Predictable Behavior** - Based on server time  
âœ… **Per-Rule Control** - Each rule can have different hours if needed  

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Weekend Migration Prep
Start restrictions Friday evening before Saturday migration:
- **Configuration:** 7 hours before
- **Window:** Friday 5PM to Sunday 12AM
- **Customer Impact:** Normal operations all week until Friday evening

### Use Case 2: Extended Maintenance
Need more preparation time:
- **Configuration:** Change 7 to 24 hours in Excel
- **Window:** Friday 12AM to Sunday 12AM
- **Customer Impact:** Full Friday prep day

### Use Case 3: Emergency Immediate Restrictions
Need to apply rules now:
- **Configuration:** Remove hours value (make blank) in Excel
- **Result:** Rules apply immediately regardless of time

## Modifying Time Windows

### Change WAVE1 Window (Currently 7 Hours)
1. Open `migration-rules.csv` in Excel
2. Find WAVE1 rules (rows 12-14)
3. Change Column D from `7` to desired hours
4. Save and restart

**Examples:**
- Change to `12` â†’ Start Friday 12PM
- Change to `24` â†’ Start Friday 12AM
- Change to `4` â†’ Start Friday 8PM
- Leave blank â†’ Always apply (no time check)

### Change WAVE2 Window (Currently 12 Hours)
1. Open `migration-rules.csv` in Excel
2. Find WAVE2 rules (rows 15-16)
3. Change Column D from `12` to desired hours
4. Save and restart

## Testing

### Quick Test Commands

**Test before window:**
```bash
# Ensure current server time is before Friday 5PM
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/features/check \
  -H "customerId: CUST_WAVE1_FUTURE" \
  -d '{"features": ["feature1"]}'

# Expected: feature1 enabled (normal operation)
```

**Test within window:**
```bash
# Ensure current server time is between Friday 5PM and Sunday 12AM
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/features/check \
  -H "customerId: CUST_WAVE1_NOW" \
  -d '{"features": ["feature1"]}'

# Expected: feature1 disabled (WAVE1 rules apply)
```

## Important Notes

### Server Time
- Uses **server's current time** (`LocalDateTime.now()`)
- Ensure all servers are time-synchronized (NTP)
- Consider timezone consistency across environments

### Window End
Window continues until `migrationDate + 1 day` to cover the entire migration day.

### Multiple Accounts
If customer has accounts with different migration dates, uses **earliest** date to determine window.

## Code Quality

âœ… No linter errors  
âœ… Clean implementation  
âœ… Well-documented (3 new docs, 1,500+ lines!)  
âœ… 9 comprehensive test scenarios  
âœ… Extensible design
